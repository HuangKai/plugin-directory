All plugins that are approved to be installed on the Figma Plus plugin store are stored on [plugins.json](https://github.com/figma-plus/plugin-directory/blob/gh-pages/plugins.json)

We do a code review on every published plugin and its updates to prevent any malicious code from running on our platform.
